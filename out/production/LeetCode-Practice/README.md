# LeetCode Practice

Welcome to my **LeetCode Practice** repository! 🚀 This repo serves as my personal log of solutions and learnings from solving various problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). It is a way to track my progress, improve my problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each problem is organized into folders based on their difficulty or topic for easier navigation:
```
LeetCode Practice/ 
├── Easy/ 
├── Medium/ 
├── Hard/ 
```

Each folder contains different problem/solution files, with different sections:
- **Problem Description**: On top in comment lines.
- **Solution**: provide in a class of the file name.
- **Test Cases**: will provide in main method.
```
/***  Description  ***
 *
 * */
public class Practice {
    // This is for solution
    public void solution(int N) {}
    
    // This is to run and to test testcases
    public static void main(String[] args) {}
}
```

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Daily Practice**: Solve at least one problem daily to maintain consistency.
2. **Understand Core Concepts**: Focus on algorithms like:
    - Arrays
    - Strings
    - Dynamic Programming
    - Graphs and Trees
    - Recursion and Backtracking
3. **Optimize Solutions**: Continuously improve time and space complexity.
